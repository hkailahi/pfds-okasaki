## Achieving Balance

> For most balanced structures, there is a notion of *perfect balance*, which is a configuration that minimizes the cost of subsequent operations. However, since it is usually too expensive to restore perfect balance after every update, most implementations settle for approximations of perfect balance that are at most a constant factor slower (Ex. AVL trees, red-black trees)
